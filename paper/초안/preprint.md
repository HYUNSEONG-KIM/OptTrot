# Fast matrix reconstruction of general combination of Clifford algebra elements


Clifford algebra has become a dominant approach in various fields for analyzing complex
systems, including computer graphics and robotics. 
In physics, it serves as a fundamental tool for representing the algebra of
quantum quantities and has extensive applications in mathematical physics.

The algebra is not only used to replace linear algebra-based methods but is also served to
 study another approach in linear algebra \cite{Matrix Exponential via Clifford Algebras}.
Conversely, by utilizing matrix representations, we can define general functions and inverses
within Clifford algebra. Thus, both matrix representation and the Clifford approach are
crucial in the study of linear and Clifford algebra systems, both practically and theoretically.

From a computational perspective, the matrix representation of Clifford elements offers 
advantages in terms of speed. Due to the inherently higher dimensions of the algebra, its time
 complexity is significantly greater than that of matrix calculations. Consequently, developing
efficient implementations of Clifford algebra systems is an important area of research in 
computer science. Even with highly optimized frameworks, matrix-based methods can demonstrate 
better performance in terms of time efficiency compared to geometric-based algorithms. 
For instance, when rapidly applying the same transformation to a large number of objects,
matrix-based methods have the advantage, with the only bottleneck being the matrix 
initialization process.

Therefore, practical computation with Clifford algebra often requires switching representations depending on the specific situation to optimize the overall speed of the algorithm. 
In this paper, we present an inverse algorithm to generate a matrix representation of general elements of Clifford algebra, based on a generalized Pauli element schema. 
The method integrates tensorized decomposition with the symplectic representation of generalized Pauli elements, which is common in Clifford frameworks as binary tree method.

In general case, matrix reconstruction routines 
were *single element reconstruction* algorithm.
Meanwhile, in here, the method is for general elements.
For example, with quatornion system, $\mathbb{H} \approx Cl_3$.

$$M = a + bi + cj + dk \rightarrow  
\begin{bmatrix} 
a + b i & c+ di\\
-c + di & a- bi
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The paper consist of 3 parts. The first is reviewing a tensorized 
decomposition algorithm of hermit matrix into generalized Pauli matrices.
In second part, we will construct a coefficient matrix with only Pauli element index
in symplectic form. 
Lastly, we will show that the inverse algorithm could be used to
construct general Clifford algebra elements. 

## Matrix representation of Clifford algebra

## Hamiltonian decomposition problem

Beside to the hermit matrix as 

### Decomposition algorithm

### Symplectic representation of Pauli elements

### Inverse algorithm

The reason why we cannot use an inverse tensorized algorithm
is that we have no idea that 
where the given generalized Pauli element would be located 
in the coefficient matrix.
Since, inverse direction also has been ambiguous so that 
the original tensorized algorithm chase the each term in
the algorithm process, so that the required memory was higher 
than the written complexity.


Lemma: 


With the above theorem, we can directly extract the corresponding Pauli element
from the coefficient index and since the bitwise XOR operator is an inverse itself.
The coefficient index from Pauli element is also well defined.
With the conversion we can directly build a coefficient matrix 
from Pauli polynomial and reconstruct the overall matrix at once.
